# <img src="asset-lib/icon.png" alt="Parallax Node Icon" title="Parallax Node Icon" width=16 height=16> ParallaxNode

A simple godot addon that adds a new ParallaxNode node that works as an alternative to the usage of ParallaxLayer and ParallaxBackground.

## ⚠ Deprecation Notice ⚠

This addon is no longer needed as of Godot 4.3's addition of `Parallax2D`, the addon will be left up for users who do not update to 4.3 or later, even if that is what I would recommend once it becomes stable.

For more information check out the [Godot 4.3 dev 5 blog post](https://godotengine.org/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-3-dev-5/) as well as the [original pull request](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/87391).
